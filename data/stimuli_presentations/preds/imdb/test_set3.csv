23,23,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want   if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killed 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny,1,1,i have to offset all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted its not like the sound of music but its as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i adored the late and great bobby vann and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters im a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in the boyfriend its a modern musical and shouldnt be judged by all that went before its just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place   no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isnt the greatest who cares i love the idea of the movie peter finch a very stiff actor liv ullmann gorgeous as ever sally kellerman surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it its not citizen kane its a feel good musical,1,1
68,68,despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers   http  imdbcom title tt0250274   those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline   see the wanna be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz   this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first,0,0,this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50s the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is undermanned and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they dont accept that charge gregory peck embodies the tight lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasnt taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson  a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre,1,1
25,25,i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didnt when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples,1,1,i have read a couple of reviews of this film which has recently been released on dvd by eclectic apparently the opening titles are letterboxed but the remainder most is full screen the first release in 1982 by planet video is completely letterboxed though it was a primitive release it did get the compositions right later releases had sharper and better picture quality but they were fullscreen as the dvd is any release of this film should be letterboxed as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape,1,1
65,65,you think youve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one,1,1,its just when a band tours and only has one original member its not the same as the classic line up all new actors playing the main roles of rag scotty etc with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie and he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females the film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon even for a t&a movie this one is a turkey not even die hard low budget 80s films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting this film would have been better off never being released just plain bad,0,0
24,24,getting lost in space frozen for 15 years thats unlikely falling into a star improbable falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ludicrous getting rescued by a ship just then priceless no its not zaphod beeblebroxs heart of gold to the rescue its also not the parent of the year awardees after sentencing her daughter to two years solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man theyve picked up this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the films action combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away who obligingly simpers in the line of fire in the end the family of three abandons the metropolis sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the psychos fighter ship which theyve refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 07 kiloton missile you have to love those hard sci fi statistics  as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill theyll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel,0,0,im no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin wrong personalitymodern make upcompletely wrong hair there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like thatshe didnt seem particularly meek nor put upon by the family and i didnt understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind the picnicsubstituted for the ball was so low budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh so claustrophobic pink sitting room to those responsible if you havent the imagination even the budget doesnt matter so much as the imagination to do something meaningful with an adaptation please dont pretend to be producing jane austen it was about 10% mansfield park and 90% nothing much at all ps edmund was very good,0,0
15,15,slow and riddled with inaccuracy over looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this made for tv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein,0,0,demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing  a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this  thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done rip off of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll 2 hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films fun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh,0,0
101,101,i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash i dont agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot   which is a point i agree with it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand standing oscar hunting lets create an enduring image for my liking the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case youre missing the point let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war if that fact alone doesnt convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance  personally i do not support americas decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly dont subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i dont think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring   unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy,0,0,while possibly the stupidest most tasteless and violent slapstick comedy ever made guest house is also a very funny one dont listen to the critics they have no sense of humour while the climax runs out of steam but not vomit its still a funny party movie seven candles in the eye out of ten,1,0
129,129,in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8,1,1,of course im a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate it took about two or three days as best i can recall webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike during the filming of our short scene  which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old  webb was very conscientious about getting things marine things right and he did a good job with one exception  that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses never happen for a host of reasons i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the worlds greatest fighting force no brag just fact what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done  the only film ive seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language when the di was made cursing wasnt allowed on screen  despite the lack of profanity its still a great movie to rent ooooo rahhhhhh semper fi do or die,1,0
146,146,men of honor   true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver fabulous cuba gooding jr is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and its part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable splendid experience charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday   role is practically written for him this film alongside with fantastic 15 minutes 2001 are two of the latest proofs that hes still one of the very finest actors of our time on the other hand men of honor includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr who has been one of the most promising young black actors since boyz n the hood men of honor goes straight into the company of jerry maguire as good as it gets and instinct cuba gooding jr is a skillful and fantastic actor and im prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him men of honor has also quite an excellent story line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history this is a great fascinating movie and i can only recommend it,1,1,i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada  particularly in quebec thats because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades as an american the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees if you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history if you are not a fan then they are satans team well at least thats how it was as i grew up in washington dc in regard to the dallas cowboys so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction  their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice the rocket richard however when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character  even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable,1,0
147,147,kojak meets the mafia telly savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable i never thought that his show was all that great this is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss with very predictable results if you take the car chases and the general rambling out there isnt much plot development or action i find mafia movies to be dull because i have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions hollywood and in this case the italian cinema treat these guys as heroes i saw the film and in a few days i wont remember much about it lots of shooting innocent bystanders dying betrayal and that sick loyalty the film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent but the dubbing is so bad due to voices that just couldnt come out of those bodies that i almost started looking for godzilla approaching the bay,0,0,simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film greats as king kong and the wolf man has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their villagea giant were rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable eating rampagehe was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were rabbit is created in the processand it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine itll be up to his loyaland startlingly intelligentand fast thinking dog gromit to save the day this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit seeing good ole fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation not to mention gut busting sight gags,1,0
151,151,i really thought this wasnt that bad not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing cello which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything hes been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects hes been involved in didnt quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases hes unfortunately been in some strange films that just didnt resonate at the box office always with a list actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing   one of his best overall films worth every penny   if you havent seen it yet do then youll understand that quote,1,0,everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to the prey endless nature footage bad acting   aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other theres also a three minute banjo solo that shows off bostwicks skill behind the instrument not too bad if i do say so myself the last ten minutes of the film are its saving grace the ending still haunts me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl bucheler does the special effects some may know him from films like troll and friday the 13th part 7   he directed both these films all in all this isnt a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven,0,1
3,3,i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious stammer overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who dont know much about parrots kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially parrots are not disposable pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts,1,1,i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great its an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb its fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by stomu yamashta with so many things going for it why isnt this a great film its a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still its engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful,1,1
9,9,theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them  ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom  if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest not recommended,0,0,pharaohs army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best ive ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as well pharaoh simply tells the true story of a small expedition forage team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions broil and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesnt feel like youre watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a story the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in she shares an interesting chemistry with coopers character and where shes the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in well the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin like metalic tint but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothes above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesnt fail in getting its point across and it gets its point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days its brave it relies on its characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasnt all cgi big stars and hoop skirts,1,1
5,5,there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlakes acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isnt all badjust mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of tenhes not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all ts just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia,0,0,firstly few colleges allow students to take courses from their parents lover secondly few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks thirdly few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm fourthly once a second member of a college small group project team meets a violent demise the college president will disband the whole class and not turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks,0,0
