78,78,i wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought id give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story wont give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didnt turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely ,0,1,this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl this young man has ever seen tiffani amber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic tiffani completes this movie which contains funny scenes put on by shore,1,1
40,40,this film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier *****spoiler alert***** polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesnt want to but polly decides to leave as she doesnt believe in marriage to begin with this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel its very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film its even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if its only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as theres something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesnt work as a comedy or as a romance,0,0,it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadnt seen before but wasnt sure why now after reflecting for quite some time i know its these characters that even now i still cant stop thinking about distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative yusuf who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer mahmut in the city in hopes to find employment however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim that hes really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of yusufs face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i dont know how long in the end mahmut has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second rating 10 out of 10,1,1
129,129,in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8,1,1,the dog can actunfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux childrens film can a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold hearted father in what can only be described as dickensian the evil widower forbids his children     who may or may not be mentally challenged     from playing with benji neither the children nor benji obeys soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them its only then that the old man realizes that benji is good not bad tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers so does the regrettably over utilized deborah walley walleys previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful its a bikini world she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good girl reputation by playing it bad  stay away from benjihes a dog and this movie is a dog,0,0
45,45,magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didnt involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and ill be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been,0,0,i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence the production value looked good and i really love the logo then after about few episodes in i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that cant even make a teacup move on camera yet everyone is terrified then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone also there is very little focus on other members of the team the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity scaring people to convert really this should be on a christian network i was very disappointed,0,0
112,112,in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of 1999it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film,1,1,this movie is about carlos the jackal quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry fieldss sutherland description appears to maim women and children for the heck of it at least thats what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos the movie isnt all shoot gun jump around action and thats a good thing in its first half ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos and thats actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run of the mill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training ramirez and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirezs new character ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an ex girlfriend of carloss naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie its a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos wannabe another thing i liked about this movie was that it didnt utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies   you know the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twins family ramirezs family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life good chuckle humor is injected into this movie often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirezs first name annibal annabelle get it also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff wasnt able to match the build up on the whole the movie was enjoyable im not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout my rating 9 10,1,0
71,71,`our song gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha maria and joycelyn   best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer   even if we dont know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain crown heights brooklyn   is was the same for us all a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school welcome heat and idleness but if this experience of adolescence is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know   maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies carving new silhouettesbeckoning new territorythe maze towards adulthood the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it is was always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s jim mckay is the writer director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him the opening title slide `a film by seems to list everyone in the universe its a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and appreciative credits ive read the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted mckays a modest leader who knows who is telling this story   its his three graces lanisha maria and joycelyn theyre the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this aint no music video shorthand telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare hanging out with them we dont quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life we are witness to the modern math of teenage life   how its problems are interpreted calculated and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job   its the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood in a connected scene lanisha defends her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams   and we remember how crazy funny kids are and more tragically how realism hammers idealism these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable `our songs greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship   how one day alive and enlivening that intimacy can in the next just turn and drift away its awful but thats just the way it is isnt it,1,1,jerry lewis was marginally funny when he didnt write his own material and had a good director like frank tashlin when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania whenever his films would fail and deservedly so in the american market they made money in france lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself for example he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was according to lewis released on a double bill with the porno feature deep throat if anyone should have complained about that situation it should have been the producers of deep throat this is an absolutely idiotic comedy about the worlds richest man lewis who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special squad to go to germany and capture hitler himself besides the many faults this film has the script is mind numbingly unfunny lewis direction is nonexistent the film has the look of a cheap home movie lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no talent over the hill borscht belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea he must have figured that they would be so bad they would make him look good he was half right they are embarrassingly bad but he comes out even worse than they do for a comedy lewis character is sullen angry and pushy the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen  ive heard that slapstick is even more pathetic but i cant bring myself to see if thats true or not  and is to be avoided at all possible costs,0,1
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,two teenagers in the north east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic misadventures but come up smiling in the end the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light hearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their adversaries are a callous teacher a pantomime villain of a father a psychotic skinhead and a well meaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim healy and kevin whateley both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so one dimensional that they have no more than novelty value chris beattie and greg mclane give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the sunderland durham area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor lad speak we say let the pooa lad speek while they say piwer lad spiyk with two distinctly different vowel sounds this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in sunderland football ground where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they dont have and *pretend* that they come from sunderland   which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit picking however the films bleak tone makes it clear that writer director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way off i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clichés tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause offence its interesting to compare the film with the same directors little voice   also largely downbeat and populated by one dimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesnt wallow in misery to the same extent ive heard belter ranked alongside this years billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life affirming experience incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on tyneside for 42 years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely belter,0,0
42,42,this movie was so bad i dont know whether to laugh or cry i had high hopes for horrorfest that year which was also the first year i attended horrorfest and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level mad kudos to the advertisers because im sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones ive seen the other ones i saw were unrest dark ride and reincarnation the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some coming of age tale about a boys transition into being a vampire which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film and to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who cant wait to take a bite out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if i had discovered what it was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film i would have left the theater halfway into the movie complete waste of money and time cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this absolute rubbish so bad that two years later i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies ive ever seen also while youre reading this steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who cant make it onto the big screen and all the crap about stuff they dont show you in theaters they werent referring to blood or guts or horrorthey were referring to the movies themselves because theyre horrendous think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival but for horror movies sorry for all the hate but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money,0,0,ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film its a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didnt incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard  there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio,1,1
87,87,when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate  if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you wont regret it ,1,1,put the film down and back slowly away the acting rivals a highschool play the plot is treadworn and the production values are slightly higher than community theater the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher rooms are switched around the dead move dogs are used for wolves men shot point blank with 45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles blouses button and unbutton without human touch this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating there is no accounting for taste btw there is no nudity,0,0
108,108,it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read if you ever needed proof that musicians cant talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou ndour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the day the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gorée off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal theres also a good deal of ndours own compositions sadly thats another weakness its never entirely clear what ndour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on ndours part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires hes clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorée museum the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but ndour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then theres europe here the black diaspora doesnt seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since ndour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because ndour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka aka leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesnt have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that ndour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorée slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile the two agendas clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which ndour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorée slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but dont expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour,0,0,i saw this movie with very low expectations i didnt know a lot about it so i wasnt sure if it was going to be worth it the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value the fact that they didnt make any attempt to fight the vines from hell they had fire and didnt try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and dont have half a brain to try to fight back,0,0
9,9,theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them  ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom  if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest not recommended,0,0,pharaohs army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best ive ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as well pharaoh simply tells the true story of a small expedition forage team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions broil and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesnt feel like youre watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a story the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in she shares an interesting chemistry with coopers character and where shes the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in well the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin like metalic tint but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothes above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesnt fail in getting its point across and it gets its point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days its brave it relies on its characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasnt all cgi big stars and hoop skirts,1,1
93,93,it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have been the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient   a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff   the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing,0,0,on the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while peck made this film during the same period that he made the gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor a pity he was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well the character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential without being a spoiler think of this film as an early grittier example of the dirty dozen genre  the dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling it contains good work by all the character actors and even barbara payton turns in a credible performance this one isnt often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy go ahead devote an evening to it it is worth your time,1,1
134,134,i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images   although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen,1,1,killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly im not all that surprised that more people havent seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didnt this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i dont hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable the last thing we need is a killjoy 3,0,0

18,18,can only be described as awful it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse   but fear not because it does another poorly written script for a donkey director for no talent offspring of past movie stars its hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both as for the hero   well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete   doesnt even blink   then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies this is a really ridiculous movie lucky it only cost me $1 to hire,0,0,whats there not to like i caught this again tonight and marvelled as to hugh bonnevilles capturing of the essence of philip larkin without resorting to tics and caricature there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life his prudish mother his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman  his poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually almost innocently it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him and knew about each other to boot and continued to see him  cerebral fun loving jazz aficionado loyal friend it is always more than looks women moved beyond his baldness deafness and short sightedness and a beautifully nuanced performance by eileen atkins as his mum is an added bonus 9 out of 10,1,1
115,115,i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldnt wait to see it what a waste of energy its kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for completionists who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynchs later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work its tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70sits interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is forgettable no really i cant remember this one at all the amputee is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd,0,0,lets see theres a civil war a lost city a talking gorilla some regular gorillas a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla the most powerful laser ever known to man a *lot* of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand attack hippos an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane thats not too much is it ive had more coherent fever dreams  and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas and as a kind of earthquake or volcano started the woman industrialist doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiances hand its a blast if youre looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment and hence world entertainment and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half hearted attempt fell on its face at the boxoffice but sadly the men responsible    crichton sceenwriter john patrick shanley director frank marshall    probably never lost a dime shame on them and i mean that 1 10,0,0
132,132,just another example of why stepehn kings books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great ive seen the major characters in movies where they were much better,0,0,unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken unforgiven though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character the acting doesnt seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around,0,0
133,133,tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years no grant character transformations no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic the balance in speed in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied the fact that this film is about nothing merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining it is brilliant because it is empty in between the lines it is happening to see or not to see thats the ,1,1,imagery controls this film the characters although interesting ultimately take a back seat the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean that then opens to full screen and color the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface the theme of the movie here being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living water as an ultimate consciousness as a tool of god is used to here to force people to get their houses in order judgment day the dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place whatever one has left unresolved or unsettled will be washed away theres no clinging on to the past to a buried memory of what was this movie has been compared to o brother where art thou and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to that film whats different in this movie is that the coming of the water is knowable and so again the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work take for example the dinner segment with the deep voiced and androgynous waitress one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards talker in the scene from fire starter the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message the men in black suits cant have anything they want they must be patient and accept what is available,1,0
90,90,why didnt this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft filmed performed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screenthe pan & scan really kills this films wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branaghs passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as hamlets murderous uncle he doesnt play him as a mustache  curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlets fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into branaghs vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece,1,1,im watching this horrid film as we speak it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house im sitting here with 3 friends and they agree its not scary its not funny its not dramatic it contains nothing appealing whatsoever we are 49 minutes in the movie weve only seen 2 critters only one person has died this movie is one big letdown nothing about this horrible horrible movie has made me want to watch the rest im getting a movie hang over i hope that everyone who had anything to do with making this movie dies i dont just mean the actors i mean the director producers the presidents from the studio that financed this movie it is in full the worst movie ever it should make the imdb worst 100 movies of all time at number 1,0,0
68,68,despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers   http  imdbcom title tt0250274   those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline   see the wanna be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz   this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first,0,0,this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50s the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is undermanned and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they dont accept that charge gregory peck embodies the tight lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasnt taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson  a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre,1,1

102,102,actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life,1,1,ive never been a huge fan of almodovar but generally ive always found something to enjoy in his films unfortunately i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display the film is essentially a love story one that is tragic and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories i found this problematic from the beginning in the opening scene our hero the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves in the opening scene our hero the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in and rolls her eyes as the woman bashfully leaves mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his true love lena played by penelope cruz the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel from the outset their union is rather a pathetic one as martel clutches jealousy to lena and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel to skip ahead martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film lena naturally without any back story lena and mateo fall in love and in almodovars world it really is that simple mateo in the opening scene has sex with a sexy young woman now mateo falls in love with lena later its revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair her son responds to this information with a laugh and an oh well again no depth no understanding for any of these characters it all just happens from the beginning of the film to the end i got no depth of emotion from mateo he is flat and doesnt act much different from one scene to the next the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer martel is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears later lena confronts martel as hes watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks some quite brilliant moments rather contrived but still really fascinating unfortunately for me the rest of the film left me rather bored i couldnt care about these characters or their situations so no amount of cleverness on almodovars part can make up for this lack of depth i think if youre a fan of his work youll enjoy this movie but if youre like me in between then youll find it lacking,0,0
