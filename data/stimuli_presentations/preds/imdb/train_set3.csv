78,78,i wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought id give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story wont give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didnt turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely ,0,1,this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl this young man has ever seen tiffani amber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic tiffani completes this movie which contains funny scenes put on by shore,1,1
40,40,this film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier *****spoiler alert***** polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesnt want to but polly decides to leave as she doesnt believe in marriage to begin with this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel its very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film its even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if its only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as theres something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesnt work as a comedy or as a romance,0,0,it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadnt seen before but wasnt sure why now after reflecting for quite some time i know its these characters that even now i still cant stop thinking about distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative yusuf who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer mahmut in the city in hopes to find employment however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim that hes really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of yusufs face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i dont know how long in the end mahmut has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second rating 10 out of 10,1,1
129,129,in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8,1,1,the dog can actunfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux childrens film can a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold hearted father in what can only be described as dickensian the evil widower forbids his children     who may or may not be mentally challenged     from playing with benji neither the children nor benji obeys soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them its only then that the old man realizes that benji is good not bad tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers so does the regrettably over utilized deborah walley walleys previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful its a bikini world she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good girl reputation by playing it bad  stay away from benjihes a dog and this movie is a dog,0,0
45,45,magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didnt involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and ill be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been,0,0,i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence the production value looked good and i really love the logo then after about few episodes in i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that cant even make a teacup move on camera yet everyone is terrified then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone also there is very little focus on other members of the team the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity scaring people to convert really this should be on a christian network i was very disappointed,0,0
112,112,in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of 1999it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film,1,1,this movie is about carlos the jackal quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry fieldss sutherland description appears to maim women and children for the heck of it at least thats what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos the movie isnt all shoot gun jump around action and thats a good thing in its first half ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos and thats actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run of the mill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training ramirez and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirezs new character ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an ex girlfriend of carloss naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie its a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos wannabe another thing i liked about this movie was that it didnt utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies   you know the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twins family ramirezs family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life good chuckle humor is injected into this movie often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirezs first name annibal annabelle get it also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff wasnt able to match the build up on the whole the movie was enjoyable im not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout my rating 9 10,1,0
71,71,`our song gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha maria and joycelyn   best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer   even if we dont know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain crown heights brooklyn   is was the same for us all a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school welcome heat and idleness but if this experience of adolescence is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know   maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies carving new silhouettesbeckoning new territorythe maze towards adulthood the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it is was always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s jim mckay is the writer director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him the opening title slide `a film by seems to list everyone in the universe its a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and appreciative credits ive read the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted mckays a modest leader who knows who is telling this story   its his three graces lanisha maria and joycelyn theyre the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this aint no music video shorthand telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare hanging out with them we dont quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life we are witness to the modern math of teenage life   how its problems are interpreted calculated and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job   its the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood in a connected scene lanisha defends her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams   and we remember how crazy funny kids are and more tragically how realism hammers idealism these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable `our songs greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship   how one day alive and enlivening that intimacy can in the next just turn and drift away its awful but thats just the way it is isnt it,1,1,jerry lewis was marginally funny when he didnt write his own material and had a good director like frank tashlin when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania whenever his films would fail and deservedly so in the american market they made money in france lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself for example he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was according to lewis released on a double bill with the porno feature deep throat if anyone should have complained about that situation it should have been the producers of deep throat this is an absolutely idiotic comedy about the worlds richest man lewis who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special squad to go to germany and capture hitler himself besides the many faults this film has the script is mind numbingly unfunny lewis direction is nonexistent the film has the look of a cheap home movie lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no talent over the hill borscht belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea he must have figured that they would be so bad they would make him look good he was half right they are embarrassingly bad but he comes out even worse than they do for a comedy lewis character is sullen angry and pushy the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen  ive heard that slapstick is even more pathetic but i cant bring myself to see if thats true or not  and is to be avoided at all possible costs,0,1
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,two teenagers in the north east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic misadventures but come up smiling in the end the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light hearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their adversaries are a callous teacher a pantomime villain of a father a psychotic skinhead and a well meaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim healy and kevin whateley both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so one dimensional that they have no more than novelty value chris beattie and greg mclane give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the sunderland durham area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor lad speak we say let the pooa lad speek while they say piwer lad spiyk with two distinctly different vowel sounds this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in sunderland football ground where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they dont have and *pretend* that they come from sunderland   which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit picking however the films bleak tone makes it clear that writer director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way off i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clichés tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause offence its interesting to compare the film with the same directors little voice   also largely downbeat and populated by one dimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesnt wallow in misery to the same extent ive heard belter ranked alongside this years billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life affirming experience incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on tyneside for 42 years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely belter,0,0
42,42,this movie was so bad i dont know whether to laugh or cry i had high hopes for horrorfest that year which was also the first year i attended horrorfest and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level mad kudos to the advertisers because im sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones ive seen the other ones i saw were unrest dark ride and reincarnation the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some coming of age tale about a boys transition into being a vampire which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film and to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who cant wait to take a bite out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if i had discovered what it was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film i would have left the theater halfway into the movie complete waste of money and time cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this absolute rubbish so bad that two years later i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies ive ever seen also while youre reading this steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who cant make it onto the big screen and all the crap about stuff they dont show you in theaters they werent referring to blood or guts or horrorthey were referring to the movies themselves because theyre horrendous think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival but for horror movies sorry for all the hate but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money,0,0,ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film its a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didnt incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard  there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio,1,1
464,464,this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you wont be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x files is in it david duchovny,1,0,this superb 40s post war classic tends to be overlooked these days when it was released in 1945 it cleaned up at the 1946 oscars mostly at the expense of `its a wonderful life both films were up for best film  best director and best actor all won by Â‘best years frederic march  and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell  a real life soldierwho lost both hands in an explosion play the returning soldiers finding life is very different  from what they remember myrna loy is superb as marchs wife who has to keep the family together while he has been awaythe tear jerking  scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent all three men find that they have problems readjusting to post war life not least russell coming to terms with artificial hands and his finance cathy odonnell  trying to be too helpful sam goldywn is quoted that he doesnt care if the film makes no money at all as long as everyone in america sees the film so they will appreciate what these men went through if any film is worth 10 out of 10 it is this one,1,1

478,478,when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time i had no expectations for that movie although it wasnt so bad as i was thought its kind of italian version of roadwarrior with cast that is almost famous in italy including venantino venantini behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh eaters you can also see other links to italian horror movies luca venantini plays the role of tommy and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi city of the living dead aka gates of hell as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of marys brother quite entertaining movie with some dull parts,1,0,oppenheimer was a great series it was the first thing i saw waterston in and it is too bad copies arent available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of insulin i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger uxb a series about defusing unexploded bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library pete,1,1
482,482,at first i didnt like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika dramabut after buying it and seeing it it wasnt that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program ilse  johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotelsin berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why ilse wasnt allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her whistlingbut this is an excellent example propagandainge and her aunt eichhornplayed by ida wust goes to the 1936 olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets carle radditz who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and its love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right sidecarl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain lookingyou see the nazi soldiers acting normallike a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier  this was a subtle put down against meat eatinglate on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they surviveanother seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now its putting the catholics down and huberts best friend helmetplayed by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ beethtoven more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ hes being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to itit injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig bleibteu the same german grandame actress who played maria holsts aunt in weiner blutwell later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movieits easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity  be careful most of the time its the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it go to ihf or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate 01 23 10 mada a mistake it wasnt herberts friend that got killed at the church  it was malte yagers characters friend schartzscop,1,0,this film winning im kwon taek the best director at cannes in 2002 tied with pt anderson for punch drunk love is about a 19th century korean painter with a commoners roots and significant impact on korean painting one of the strengthsof the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend jang seung up choi min shikreceive inspiration the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good its not a movie that moved me but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it thats pretty cool its also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the chosun kingdom is coming to an end more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film but are never the center its firmly on the painter in the end its a well made film about the life of a painter but it doesnt exactly have the regular three act structure plot so you have to be able to take a non standard hollywood story to watch it yay for art 8 10,1,1
484,484,i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section to tell you the truth the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didnt have a choice  d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs but it turned out to be semi gore flick somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct i really couldnt care less if potentes character got her entrails ripped out by the creep i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potentes character getting her just desserts christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film however the story is rather weak but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch that more than anything else really scared the crap out of me the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q&a session i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future this one is strictly for genre fans but id recommend non fans to give this a try anyway it was a fun ride,1,0,i have to preface this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining this movie delivers 100% it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city people walking traffic the skyline etc that doesnt tie into anything then there are the overly long sex scenes these involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each others bodies these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called barely legal girls who couldnt be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him no one had to memorize any lines for this movie if they arent clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue then theres mr creepo he throws ed woods name around like he can somehow compare but he is far far from anything of that quality he walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on we couldnt stop laughing during this movie except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified i give this movie a 1 10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie,0,0
545,545,whilst reading through the comments left for this show i couldnt help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will the thing about kerching is that its a childrens show for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy forced and probably stupid i even found one person saying the sets were stupid but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine they didnt yeah it can be annoying the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair but as a kids show i rate it 10 10 compared to the stuff they air in its place today well lets just say i wish itd be re aired dvd release anyone,1,0,i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand butthere are exceptions i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast forward button for large chunks of the story those movies are the mighty gorga night of the seagulls and this little crap deep blood in the world of jaws ripoffs this falls off the scale deep blood doesnt have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent nor the commentary of tintorera no instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed 80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange ish paint thrown into the water not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump normally i or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool i gotta find a copy of this thats the same thought i had when i read another viewers review on this very site how wrong i was sofrom one bad movie fan to anotherlet this collect dust on the shelfgrab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water,0,0
562,562,it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garberwhom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves,1,0,just watched this on dvd three times   once the normal way once with the scenes in consecutive order in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine and once with the directors commentary running quite amazing a bare bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big budget overblown features being released today  i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento which turned me on to nolan in the first place cant wait to see what he does with a bigger budget and bigger box office stars in his next film insomnia,1,1
586,586,the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film    and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawd to me this is the worst kind of film    one that assumes its a work of art because it has all the trappings of film as art yes its beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease its hot it has drama its audacious    precisely what this film is not,0,1,everything i can say is that its one of the best documentary movies of the ocean ever seen it impresses immensely by professional filming scenery and idea what ive seen during those 50 minutes cannot be compared to any other visions of the blue planet,1,1
87,87,when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate  if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you wont regret it ,1,1,put the film down and back slowly away the acting rivals a highschool play the plot is treadworn and the production values are slightly higher than community theater the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher rooms are switched around the dead move dogs are used for wolves men shot point blank with 45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles blouses button and unbutton without human touch this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating there is no accounting for taste btw there is no nudity,0,0
108,108,it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read if you ever needed proof that musicians cant talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou ndour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the day the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gorée off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal theres also a good deal of ndours own compositions sadly thats another weakness its never entirely clear what ndour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on ndours part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires hes clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorée museum the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but ndour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then theres europe here the black diaspora doesnt seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since ndour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because ndour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka aka leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesnt have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that ndour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorée slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile the two agendas clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which ndour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorée slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but dont expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour,0,0,i saw this movie with very low expectations i didnt know a lot about it so i wasnt sure if it was going to be worth it the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value the fact that they didnt make any attempt to fight the vines from hell they had fire and didnt try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and dont have half a brain to try to fight back,0,0
9,9,theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them  ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom  if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest not recommended,0,0,pharaohs army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best ive ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as well pharaoh simply tells the true story of a small expedition forage team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions broil and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesnt feel like youre watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a story the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in she shares an interesting chemistry with coopers character and where shes the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in well the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin like metalic tint but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothes above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesnt fail in getting its point across and it gets its point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days its brave it relies on its characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasnt all cgi big stars and hoop skirts,1,1
93,93,it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have been the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient   a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff   the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing,0,0,on the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while peck made this film during the same period that he made the gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor a pity he was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well the character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential without being a spoiler think of this film as an early grittier example of the dirty dozen genre  the dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling it contains good work by all the character actors and even barbara payton turns in a credible performance this one isnt often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy go ahead devote an evening to it it is worth your time,1,1
134,134,i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images   although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen,1,1,killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly im not all that surprised that more people havent seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didnt this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i dont hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable the last thing we need is a killjoy 3,0,0
68,68,despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers   http  imdbcom title tt0250274   those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline   see the wanna be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz   this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first,0,0,this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50s the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is undermanned and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they dont accept that charge gregory peck embodies the tight lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasnt taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson  a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre,1,1
102,102,actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life,1,1,ive never been a huge fan of almodovar but generally ive always found something to enjoy in his films unfortunately i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display the film is essentially a love story one that is tragic and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories i found this problematic from the beginning in the opening scene our hero the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves in the opening scene our hero the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in and rolls her eyes as the woman bashfully leaves mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his true love lena played by penelope cruz the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel from the outset their union is rather a pathetic one as martel clutches jealousy to lena and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel to skip ahead martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film lena naturally without any back story lena and mateo fall in love and in almodovars world it really is that simple mateo in the opening scene has sex with a sexy young woman now mateo falls in love with lena later its revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair her son responds to this information with a laugh and an oh well again no depth no understanding for any of these characters it all just happens from the beginning of the film to the end i got no depth of emotion from mateo he is flat and doesnt act much different from one scene to the next the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer martel is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears later lena confronts martel as hes watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks some quite brilliant moments rather contrived but still really fascinating unfortunately for me the rest of the film left me rather bored i couldnt care about these characters or their situations so no amount of cleverness on almodovars part can make up for this lack of depth i think if youre a fan of his work youll enjoy this movie but if youre like me in between then youll find it lacking,0,0
79,79,this is the least scary film i have ever seen how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film the blob moves so slowly that an oap in a zimmerframe could escape it the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten if you havent seen this film i recommend you do its far too funny to be taken seriously,0,0,friz frelengs snafuperman is one of the lesser private snafu shorts a warning of the importance of studying your field manual snafuperman makes it point rather clumsily the story in which technical fairy first class makes snafu into a superhuman in order to help him see the error of his ways is predictable and unfunny frelengs earlier snafu short rumours had been bursting with ideas and laughs but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it even at around three minutes long snafuperman seems to drag and unlike the best cartoons in the series it feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual warner cartoons the snafu shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard snafuperman is a reflection of the sort of quality youd more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds,0,0
12,12,finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a non documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass its all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader its near perfect where where can i get hold of it,1,1,if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors eating non ants and conquering the world with a voice over narrative then this is the movie for you basically a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail i guess they just couldnt afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly the title of the movie phase iv is something of a mystery this is not a spoiler but phase i starts right after the opening credits whereas you dont reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1   3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as a mst3k episode this one wasnt very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even j&tb can lighten it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies the movie does have a trick surprise ending but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me,0,0
599,599,this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities perverted sex greed violence and intolerance all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the slags flat you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through 1 10 for fun 8 10 for displaying man as he sometimes is,0,1,ive never saw the first three but i know theyre all better than thistrash its about some kid who throws a party wow sounds amazingsarcasm is it nooo it starts off with a kid laying in bed and hes getting woke up by his mom so the kid pretends to be sick so he doesnt have to go to school he goes to his uncles house and rounds up some people and throws a party i didnt laugh at all while watching this trash i cant imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking man dis @#$ is gunna be big yo makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie i watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of this just disgusted me two thumbs down,0,0
641,641,i came to nancy drew expecting the worstbecause of everyone elses bad reviews i thought even though i dont read the books that doesnt look anything like the nancy drew ive heard of but i was wrong sure it wasnt a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become big screen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz she was intelligent conservative polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick what a flick and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was like freaking out go see it or be a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for youa mistake i almost made i love it i wanna own this movie i love emma roberts now too shes like a mini bree van de kamp from dh love it love it,1,0,im not sure whether i like this film or not i think it is creepy and completely weirdcrispin glover as always gave a great performance as layne i think his performance was really good and one of his best but i dont like the character at all keanu reeves performance was really good and i truly felt for his character over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real i disliked some but genuinely felt sorry for others keanu reeves i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didnt end how i expected it to i was disappointed in the ending and i dont feel that it did the rest of the film justice if you are into creepy weird and really well different movies go for this one if you like things that are normal please stay away,1,1
