19,19,i had to give this film a 1 because its that bad but dont make this think that i didnt enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warriors swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and theres some crappy model effects those arent supposed to be real trees are they and i still dont understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so dont let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons its much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i dont think so rent it and youll see yo,0,0,with a name like 10 commandments you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible specifically exodus not so here this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark made film remember noah that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made at least this film had some truth to the original story however menerith who was a major character in this movie   half brother of moses is not in the original story other characters were absent not to mention important events were completely eliminated so what you may ask because this should be representative of the actual story otherwise some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened in todays age people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible also it is a great error see revelation 2218 19 the script is already written why change it other than the account in exodus itself which should be the main focus you have the cecil b demille film to compare it to which is clearly a far better presentation the night it first aired my wife was anxious to see it i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark film she looked puzzled and said why hallmark makes good movies that might be so but they butcher the bible im sorry to say that i was correct not just the story but the acting as well with todays technology you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie im still waiting,0,0
53,53,i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx beyonce knowles danny glover the movie couldnt be less than 4 out of 4 stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy anika noni rose and jennifer hudson eddie murphys james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudsons performance compels you to pay attention each time shes on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades shes receiving for this performance anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent  jamie foxx and beyonce knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances foxxs acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ray performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie her performance wasnt strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film the movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song beyonces heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long dh    vancouver wa,0,0,the story of how the communist leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu a story of struggle and injustice of hope and the search of freedom the story could be the one of any african country a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty if you have to see only one foreign film this year see this one,1,1
109,109,i dont know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co star gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman hes just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too in short its a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse,1,1,if you dont like bad acting poor editing ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie if you like all of the above that is to say if you are a lynch fan then you will love mulholland drive this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 70 on imdb outside of naomi watts work you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in mulholland dr the other female lead went to the hide your face with your hands when you dont have the chops school of acting given the script they had to work with its a wonder all of the actors werent holding their heads in their hands characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline you have a hitman a mysterious cowboy an adulterous wife and her cliched poolman lover a mafioso type figure sitting in a darkened room who speaks through an external voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time this isnt so bad however in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no discernable plot you will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed the hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled the easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and jumble them up at the end for the sake of surprise guess which way lynch goes surprise you know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it after all a dream sequence covers all sins dreams dont have to make sense anything can happen in a dream the editing is similarly disjointed lets just say good editing does not call attention to itself much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing look at me you can see my editing arent i a genius uh well no this movie has all of the earmarks of the worst and most self indulgent french films so why is this movie so popular my theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture melodies are hard to compose so lets listen to rap plots are hard to follow so lets dispense with them pictures are difficult to paint so lets pee in a cup and stick a crucifix in it these are the symptoms of our times and mulholland drive is just another part of the affliction,0,0
117,117, according to reviewers the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year old college kids about to enter grad school jolly joke 1955 the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970s the pony car at best is from the mid 1960s 20 year old college kids josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made for tv movie was produced the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tvs,0,1,i first saw this movie at a video store and being the bam margera fan i am had to rent it to see what it was all about since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious some of the parts are pointless and random but thats what makes them so amusing youll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie i was really impressed i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job nothing oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used i wouldnt suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa all in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to,1,1
121,121,back in 74 eric monte made the classic tv show good times jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on tv land jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie walkers popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if jj wouldt have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended instead of 1974 1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980s when i was just growing up,1,1,there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden panattiere was sub par both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character kirresha,0,0
46,46,i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene  both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cant feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even wanda sykes rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies arent for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that doesnt usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film 3 1 2* out of 5*,1,1,ok first to all the haters get a life i dont see why you even bother to post on these boards when obviously you know nothing about cinema robots or people  this movie has an important lessons for all of us to learn about gender stereotypes relationships and destiny really we are all robots programmed to respond certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking how many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comment without even thinking about it i say thank you aqua brilliantly played by bernadette peters for making me stop and think about the awesome power of mother nature  its only when val and aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire  to find love and to flee the factory in search of a creative life this movie should be mandatory viewing in prisons  just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire in the inmates maybe even they could overcome their bad programming and join the rest of us in a crime free world we can all learn a lot from these robots i am a better person for heartbeeps,1,1
3,3,i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious stammer overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who dont know much about parrots kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially parrots are not disposable pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts,1,1,i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great its an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb its fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by stomu yamashta with so many things going for it why isnt this a great film its a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still its engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful,1,1
111,111,flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x 77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job & everything goes well until the x 77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x 77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands co writer & executive producer steven seagal to get it back & kill all the bad guys in the process this american british & romanian co production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 & attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasnt working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days its boring even though its not that slow the characters are poor its full of clichés things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent & its a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame & theres no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes & its right down there with the worst seagal has made flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isnt even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as its all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited its hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap & shoddy the imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12000000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed again flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish & is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more,0,0,a photographer in the small city of gunsan in south korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends we never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of hur jin hos poignant first film christmas in august is not his illness it is the grace in which he conducts his life   his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse sadly it was the final film shot by cinematographer yoo young kil before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory the photographer jung won is played by han suk kyu at one time koreas most popular star a handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life jung won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father goo shin and sister oh ji hye teaching his dad how to play movies on the vcr and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die as jung won goes about the day to day business of getting his affairs in order dar im shim eun ha a meter reader comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements abrupt and impatient he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer without overt expression of romantic feelings their relationship develops a growing intimacy love is not something they say or do it is their ground of being the place where they come from to protect dar im from suffering jung won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shops window although jung wons decision to withhold his illness from dar im is open to question it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to live life to the fullest by playing around one of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself jung won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance christmas in august is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point it is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments riding a bike sharing a joke eating ice cream being thoughtful and considerate and feeling good about what life has to offer it is a love story where love means having to say youre sorry although there have been many films on the dying process christmas in august propels the genre in a new direction and in the process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition incongruously this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy,1,1
25,25,i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didnt when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples,1,1,i have read a couple of reviews of this film which has recently been released on dvd by eclectic apparently the opening titles are letterboxed but the remainder most is full screen the first release in 1982 by planet video is completely letterboxed though it was a primitive release it did get the compositions right later releases had sharper and better picture quality but they were fullscreen as the dvd is any release of this film should be letterboxed as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape,1,1
118,118,this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too small part despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable michelle monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for downeys characters obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way its portrayed the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so fans of the film say that those who disagree simply dont get it i dont think this is so the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured i got it i just didnt like it paddy breathnachs i went down and guy ritchies snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of film making that director shane black fails to achieve i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwritermakes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection,0,0,we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon it had me laughing out loud many times the scene about albert einsteins thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldnt stop laughing its too bad its not in more theaters i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie welcome to costco i love you  great work to all involved also if you see it make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well im going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure if youre a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie its a classic and no one knows that its out so if youre in the mood to see something funny this weekend definitely check it out,1,1
99,99,i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas coffee phone play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid  _  i think im done never mind im still not done what is this a joke why do we have to go all the way to line ten really whats the point of it i will just right random words for now  _  maple story is fun i love my friends,1,0,undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever balance of terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense with intelligent real world parallels the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the us and the soviet union during the cold war spot on characterizations and the introduction of star treks second most important hostile alien race after the klingons the romulans  after receiving a distress call from a federation outpost the enterprise is dangerously close to the neutral zone which if crossed would lead to open conflict with the romulans although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh soon enough a romulan vessel appears carrying a new weapon and a cloaking device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat facing the threat of imminent annihilation kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the romulan commander mark lenard to ensure the survival of his crew unfortunately the task is made more difficult when one of the men accuses spock of being in league with the enemy due to the physical resemblance between romulans and vulcans two races that are in fact distantly related a fact that is quite ironic with hindsight given lenard went on to play spocks father sarek starting with season 2 always very critical when it came to the subject of war star trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic although the romulans arent actually based on the soviets the name is actually taken from romulus the founder of rome the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear american and russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons that fear gave birth to the titular concept of balance of terror but even without the subtext this remains an essential episode due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two adversaries which translates into a thesping duel between shatner and lenard no need to say who wins,1,1
86,86,i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasnt a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i havent seen films subjecting gay porn dont keep your expectations high thoughthen you will be very disappointed * out of *****,0,0,ive seen some bible based trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kids biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor   take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it gods conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of lets make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses takenthat is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor,0,0
27,27,i would almost give it 10 out of 10 however there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss leading which hurt the flow continuity of the film the story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it the characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head its a film where all is explained in the end the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else ive seen in animation it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so its worth watching it on a good tv or plasma the character voices do save this film in its english version but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence this is just a personal suggestion,1,1,this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien & co walking through the jungle and theres this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if hes reading them off the cue cards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well its positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed   the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like theyre bouncing around on bungee cords or something yeahanyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and theyre attacked by more vampires its really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it doesnt help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand to hand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tactics theres a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes its her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van diens ex wife hey what are the odds its a shame shes not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who cant act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo shes more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie i dont know it might score some points on the so bad its good scale but thats about it eh its a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess its kind of entertaining,0,0
135,135,before i explain the alias comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen laroux as semi  bad girl juanita when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short saved by the belle  in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53  minute movie is moe hitting curly waynes character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy  playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne robs the box office no explanation is given for waynes ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl  things get complicated at this point because the villain al ferguson and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff micah on televisions the rifleman see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager moe and curly get blamed  so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie  larrys sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roachs our gang shorts kornman is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them  even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film  making is staggeringly bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing  one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background  then again what do i know im only a child,0,1,usual awful movie ill not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evil planner military officer and one or two solve all nukes and youll have the movie if i can call it that way  seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives  the big one is approaching nuke some places and its over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didnt like transformers nuke yourself but i cant assure this will fix things in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke,0,0
47,47,fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again   and maybe again,1,1,if you are looking for a film that is quick witted and wont bore you then this is the place it is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters it is always hard for me to see mark walhberg as anything except marky mark that image is burned in my mind forever as an actor though he is pretty good this movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns i will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it,1,1
14,14,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self desctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best simon geist is a man in his late 30s early 40s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indie art house crowd mark my words ,1,1,anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergmans ability to play comedy need only look to the bells of st marys ok so shes a nun with tb whos probably in love with fr omalley think what luis bunuel could have done with that but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often in cactus flower shes a starched dentists nurse walter matthau is the dentist in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up when shes forced to act as his wife in order to hoodwink his mistress dont ask she lets loose and the buttons pop and shes a joy to behold the movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit you can see its three acts its a french farce it was originally its taken from the play fleur de cactas by pierre barillet and jean pierre gredy and it hits all the right spots matthau uses his great hang jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer as she was then called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for the wife even though the wife is having a ball hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress,1,1
48,48,okthis movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enoughbut then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines its not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brotherswho were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case the film didnt seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p,0,1,saw the move while in paris in may 2006  i was debating between that and mission impossiblei am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france i had a great time would recommend it it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie  cannot wait for the dvd to come out i dont know how some of the jeu de mots puns would be translated in english i ll certainly buy it when it is out ps i saw on brice de nice which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imaginein comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117,1,1
120,120,this is cult stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry  ive seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy itthe actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing if you enjoyed morons from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the worlds i love the red neck rampage to get the aliens the bug on the hood the dod the heat seeking populous annihilator the mine field the red camo breaking the speed limit by 1800mph ill get the bucket very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd forget the negative reviews see it for yourself,1,1,im an action movie fan but until today ive never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy so i went to see the long kiss goodnight on pay tv hoping for nothing special but what a surprise this movie is great the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot but the rest is the most entertaining intriguing and funny action movie ever made the transformation of samantha charly from ordinary wife teacher to cool blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea the action scenes and the stunts are the best ive ever seen samuel l jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good and what about geena she is wonderful she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong convincing acting and fantastic stunts so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles 9 10,1,1
44,44,perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride,1,1,it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks this is a great horror spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances its laughs are subtle but plentiful because there is very little if any cgi there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera man must be sh%#@ing his pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so far more enjoyable than the big budget re made garbage being released by hollywood today see it,1,1
6,6,boy this was one lousy movie while i havent seen all of the burton taylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put upon staff when shes suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it werent for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars,0,0,ok so i really like kris kristofferson and his usual easy going delivery of lines in his movies age has helped him with his soft spoken low energy style and he will steal a scene effortlessly but disappearance is his misstep holy moly this was a bad movie  i must give kudos to the cinematography and and the actors including kris for trying their darndest to make sense from this goofy confusing story none of it made sense and kris probably didnt understand it either and he was just going through the motions hoping someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about  i dont care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project or some such nonsense ive seen low budget movies that had a plot for goodness sake this had none zilcho nada zippo empty of reason a complete waste of good talent scenery and celluloid  i rented this piece of garbage for a buck and i want my money back i want my 2 hours back i invested on this grade f waste of my time dont watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where its playing or even open up the case that is holding the dvd believe me youll thank me for the advice,0,0
92,92,this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great mr james had ever come up with a tale this thin    doesnt james in fact have a story called a thin ghost    he wouldnt have bothered to have it published orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this films producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o the wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit,0,0,i watched this film early 70sit is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal rezone  i watched this film early 70sit is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal rezone  i watched this film early 70sit is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal rezone ,1,1
23,23,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want   if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killed 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny,1,1,i have to offset all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted its not like the sound of music but its as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i adored the late and great bobby vann and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters im a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in the boyfriend its a modern musical and shouldnt be judged by all that went before its just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place   no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isnt the greatest who cares i love the idea of the movie peter finch a very stiff actor liv ullmann gorgeous as ever sally kellerman surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it its not citizen kane its a feel good musical,1,1
58,58,spoilers wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so hes trying to figure out whos receiving the messages and whos also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and hes gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesnt see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end thats it  ive never seen such a dull movie in my life its the most underwhelming movie ive ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they dont care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasnt expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didnt expect it to be this bad christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well im sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst its beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever,0,0,28 years before 9 11 there was another 9 11 which represented a key date in the history of chile south america and the whole world this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allendes rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world true he was democratically elected but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis he was deposed by a coup and a right wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution well never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded the authors of the movie take a completely pro allende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future,0,0
