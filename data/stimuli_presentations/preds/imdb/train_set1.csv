19,19,i had to give this film a 1 because its that bad but dont make this think that i didnt enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warriors swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and theres some crappy model effects those arent supposed to be real trees are they and i still dont understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so dont let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons its much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i dont think so rent it and youll see yo,0,0,with a name like 10 commandments you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible specifically exodus not so here this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark made film remember noah that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made at least this film had some truth to the original story however menerith who was a major character in this movie   half brother of moses is not in the original story other characters were absent not to mention important events were completely eliminated so what you may ask because this should be representative of the actual story otherwise some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened in todays age people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible also it is a great error see revelation 2218 19 the script is already written why change it other than the account in exodus itself which should be the main focus you have the cecil b demille film to compare it to which is clearly a far better presentation the night it first aired my wife was anxious to see it i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark film she looked puzzled and said why hallmark makes good movies that might be so but they butcher the bible im sorry to say that i was correct not just the story but the acting as well with todays technology you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie im still waiting,0,0
53,53,i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx beyonce knowles danny glover the movie couldnt be less than 4 out of 4 stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy anika noni rose and jennifer hudson eddie murphys james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudsons performance compels you to pay attention each time shes on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades shes receiving for this performance anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent  jamie foxx and beyonce knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances foxxs acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ray performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie her performance wasnt strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film the movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song beyonces heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long dh    vancouver wa,0,0,the story of how the communist leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu a story of struggle and injustice of hope and the search of freedom the story could be the one of any african country a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty if you have to see only one foreign film this year see this one,1,1
4,4,lets face it the final season #8 was one of the worst seasons in any show ive ever enjoyed mostly ive never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course its going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair assessment   because that 70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there werent so different than we are here in modern times all right ignoring season 8 topher grace stars as eric forman a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna laura prepon the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde mila kunis jackie wilmer valderrama fez and even ashton kutcher kelso give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably fez a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get what country is he from try to figure it out for another dimension of entertainment debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as erics parents rupp as kitty is both formidable and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie barone while smiths red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donnas parents the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a stoner who acts as a father figure to hyde apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over the top lessons that sometimes come and that deplorable final season 70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spot on direction and a feel good vibe pulsing through every episode theyre all alright,1,0,about as hilarious as 50s british comedy can get the belles of st trinians has almost a gag a minute and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time other films i equally recommend of the same period are the titfield thunderbolt and the green man in fact any film with alistair sim or terry thomas george cole richard wattis or joyce grenfell or any combination is a delight in st trinians we get a double dose of sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face joyce grenfell as ruby gates oh dear that name plays her jolly hockey sticks constable incognito to hilarious perfection possibly the best laughs come from george cole as flash harry who comes out of a bush when whistled at and various visits to classrooms by ms fritton sims reacting to explosions oh poor betty or science lab gin production just send a few bottles of that up to my room every part of the film is funny from the characters their costumes the antics and the setting there were sequels but the first three are the best including this one blue murder at st trinians and later in color the great st trinians train robbery,1,1
33,33,the story would never win awards but thats not what its about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really its worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7,1,0,a klutzy young man returns west after being schooled in the hotel business via boston he quickly learns his friends in spanish colonized old california expect him to fill his deceased fathers shoes instead  that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them colorful but silly m g m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera but it never takes off this might have been fun second string material for abbott & costello but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror but one doesnt concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way kathryn grayson is the governors daughter who falls for frank and her high soprano trilling turns her singing scenes into self parody aside from robert surtees cinematography and the decent art direction this bandit remains kissless * from ****,0,1
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the tv and came across this film i dont ever remember seeing this or hearing of it what a fun and interesting one to watch well my meeting was pushed back because i couldnt get out of this film it had some real interesting things in it that marked its time in history and some fun things that they dont have people do in todays film because its not pretty well there was a lot of realism in it the acting was good for a 1954 film subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next that is why i ended up watching it i dont know why they dont show it more often i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary for history buffs people who like period films and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one the egyptian has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since its time what does that say about us those that dont like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good storyare not into film i havent had the time to rent it if it is available but if i get a chance to see it again i would probably vote it a 10,1,1
78,78,i wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought id give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story wont give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didnt turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely ,0,1,the omission of jazzy jeff the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch raised a few eyebrows but its good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all with scratch doug pray who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the 90s in hype 1996 made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip hop dj and the evolution of turntablism his latest documentary infamy 2005 explores contemporary american graffiti culture after a couple of viewings four years ago my dvd had been gathering dust ever since but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material i was surprised how well shot and edited this documentary actually is an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads but lots of music old school footage parties break dancing you name it one of the best things about the film is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today in 2001 that is without disregarding the pioneers of course good stuff camera obscura     8 10,1,1
99,99,i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas coffee phone play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid  _  i think im done never mind im still not done what is this a joke why do we have to go all the way to line ten really whats the point of it i will just right random words for now  _  maple story is fun i love my friends,1,0,from the opening shot of the meteor falling towards earth you know youre in for something special this is an ultra low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters the story is unremarkable and nothing you havent seen a thousand times before the acting isnt great but isnt completely horrible however the special effects   of which there are a good deal   are laughable at best in fact if you can read this sentence chances are better than 50% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers the movies saving grace   if youre in the mood for a grade z turkey of a film   is that theres always something happening and it never gets boring and if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends you might just find this worth a dollar rental and i must say i appreciated the opening joke that is the dumbest name for an island ive ever heard probably the best moment in the movie,0,0
117,117, according to reviewers the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year old college kids about to enter grad school jolly joke 1955 the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970s the pony car at best is from the mid 1960s 20 year old college kids josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made for tv movie was produced the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tvs,0,1,on one thursday evening at 1000pm my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of northern exposure the abc network usually airs men in trees in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest exposure in washington state trees in vancouver bc re watching northern exposure as well as few episodes of sex and the city reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid men in trees  anne heche can be a good actress with the right material unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast i am not convinced of her fish out of water character i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes the hot looking local the kindly bar owner the bush pilot the local police officers the dim but well intentioned radio dj etc the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran er actor abraham benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james mangold his movies heavy and cop land had lead characters who were large men then i am not surprised why benrubi was cast in a non typical role nonetheless i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love men in trees it fits the quirky niche for television audiences i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows,0,1
151,151,i really thought this wasnt that bad not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing cello which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything hes been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects hes been involved in didnt quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases hes unfortunately been in some strange films that just didnt resonate at the box office always with a list actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing   one of his best overall films worth every penny   if you havent seen it yet do then youll understand that quote,1,0,everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to the prey endless nature footage bad acting   aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other theres also a three minute banjo solo that shows off bostwicks skill behind the instrument not too bad if i do say so myself the last ten minutes of the film are its saving grace the ending still haunts me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl bucheler does the special effects some may know him from films like troll and friday the 13th part 7   he directed both these films all in all this isnt a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven,0,1
160,160,i liked it the plot was weird drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool and as always he does his best   im a major dennis fan anyway thats why i bought the dvd i didnt get the ending that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool which is ok i guess but it could have been more  and the whole thing with the knife  if it was that uncomfortable why didnt they just get rid of it  it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc or was it dennis all the time because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice the music was ok but obtrusive in places the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude  all in all a bit of a gpm guilty pleasure movie dont read too much into it dont look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it there are some diamond moments and goofs galore  watch it and just have a bit of fun with it,1,0,theres a sign on the lost highway that says *major spoilers ahead* but you already knew that didnt you since theres a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie id like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of md you can cheat by looking at david lynchs top 10 hints to unlocking md but only upon second or third viewing please  first of all mulholland drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but vogues it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it   cinematography wise has great acting esp naomi watts a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti and a very dream like quality to it    but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldnt leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated it allright enough about all that its time to justify those statements most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence of course thats too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again  md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor camilla rowles due to dianes lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents expectations upon realizing that camilla will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam kesher the director she hires a hitman to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dance jitterbug contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and applauding her no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it theres actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits   the camera moving into an object although blurry and the scene quickly fading out if you look closely the object is actually a pillow revealing that what follows is a dream the main characters seen in the first half of the movie betty diane selwyns imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream sequence   a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane betty was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies notice that in the dream version the waitresses name is diane rita the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that through dianes dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an amnesiac this makes her vulnerable and dependent on dianes love she is then conveniently placed in betty dianes aunts luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in coco in real life adams mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in shes mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him aunt ruth dianes real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camillas murder mr roach a typical lynchian character not real appears only in dianes dream sequence hes a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks the hitman the person that murders camilla this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out chronologically but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to lynch hint sheet as i mentioned above camilla was re produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with md is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isnt ive already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow but notice how theres two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo only one of the cars actually hit the limo what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldnt they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences lingers over what it finds fascinating dismisses unpromising plotlines shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruths apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what were seeing is a nightmare although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think theyre actually her parents since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest perhaps she didnt know them all that well and didnt really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and dianes sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camillas part in the movie from adams party in the second half of the movie and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal this scene i think is also lynchs attempt at totally screwing his audience over since theyre given a false pretence in which to view the movie gotta love that something just bit me bad line though  the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that theyre sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene when reaching the corner a bum like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in dianes mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her obessions translate into that poor guys nightmares the bum also signifies dianes evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie the cowboy constitutes along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape    diane only saw him for a short while at adams party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what were seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times indicating to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide the espresso scene with the castigliane brothers where we can see badalamenti the composer as luigi is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adams party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch during the scene in which they enter dianes apartment the body lying in the bed is camilla but notice how shes assumed dianes sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness since diane did not know where or when the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off she just put her into her own home in real life dianes audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition   leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for camillas murder now appears in rita camillas purse this is part of dianes undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasnt taken place when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped ashtray another hint is given she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that bettys encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camillas photo resume the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed theres much symbolism going on here the box may represent dianes future its empty or it may be a sort of a pandoras box the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreams during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears anyway that is my $002 hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it the worst movie ever or something to that effect without realizing the plot as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well 10 out of 10,1,0
86,86,i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasnt a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i havent seen films subjecting gay porn dont keep your expectations high thoughthen you will be very disappointed * out of *****,0,0,ive seen some bible based trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kids biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor   take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it gods conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of lets make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses takenthat is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor,0,0
27,27,i would almost give it 10 out of 10 however there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss leading which hurt the flow continuity of the film the story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it the characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head its a film where all is explained in the end the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else ive seen in animation it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so its worth watching it on a good tv or plasma the character voices do save this film in its english version but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence this is just a personal suggestion,1,1,this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien & co walking through the jungle and theres this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if hes reading them off the cue cards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well its positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed   the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like theyre bouncing around on bungee cords or something yeahanyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and theyre attacked by more vampires its really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it doesnt help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand to hand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tactics theres a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes its her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van diens ex wife hey what are the odds its a shame shes not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who cant act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo shes more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie i dont know it might score some points on the so bad its good scale but thats about it eh its a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess its kind of entertaining,0,0
135,135,before i explain the alias comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen laroux as semi  bad girl juanita when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short saved by the belle  in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53  minute movie is moe hitting curly waynes character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy  playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne robs the box office no explanation is given for waynes ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl  things get complicated at this point because the villain al ferguson and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff micah on televisions the rifleman see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager moe and curly get blamed  so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie  larrys sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roachs our gang shorts kornman is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them  even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film  making is staggeringly bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing  one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background  then again what do i know im only a child,0,1,usual awful movie ill not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evil planner military officer and one or two solve all nukes and youll have the movie if i can call it that way  seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives  the big one is approaching nuke some places and its over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didnt like transformers nuke yourself but i cant assure this will fix things in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke,0,0
14,14,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self desctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best simon geist is a man in his late 30s early 40s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indie art house crowd mark my words ,1,1,anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergmans ability to play comedy need only look to the bells of st marys ok so shes a nun with tb whos probably in love with fr omalley think what luis bunuel could have done with that but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often in cactus flower shes a starched dentists nurse walter matthau is the dentist in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up when shes forced to act as his wife in order to hoodwink his mistress dont ask she lets loose and the buttons pop and shes a joy to behold the movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit you can see its three acts its a french farce it was originally its taken from the play fleur de cactas by pierre barillet and jean pierre gredy and it hits all the right spots matthau uses his great hang jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer as she was then called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for the wife even though the wife is having a ball hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress,1,1
48,48,okthis movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enoughbut then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines its not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brotherswho were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case the film didnt seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p,0,1,saw the move while in paris in may 2006  i was debating between that and mission impossiblei am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france i had a great time would recommend it it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie  cannot wait for the dvd to come out i dont know how some of the jeu de mots puns would be translated in english i ll certainly buy it when it is out ps i saw on brice de nice which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imaginein comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117,1,1
120,120,this is cult stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry  ive seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy itthe actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing if you enjoyed morons from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the worlds i love the red neck rampage to get the aliens the bug on the hood the dod the heat seeking populous annihilator the mine field the red camo breaking the speed limit by 1800mph ill get the bucket very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd forget the negative reviews see it for yourself,1,1,im an action movie fan but until today ive never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy so i went to see the long kiss goodnight on pay tv hoping for nothing special but what a surprise this movie is great the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot but the rest is the most entertaining intriguing and funny action movie ever made the transformation of samantha charly from ordinary wife teacher to cool blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea the action scenes and the stunts are the best ive ever seen samuel l jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good and what about geena she is wonderful she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong convincing acting and fantastic stunts so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles 9 10,1,1
44,44,perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride,1,1,it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks this is a great horror spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances its laughs are subtle but plentiful because there is very little if any cgi there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera man must be sh%#@ing his pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so far more enjoyable than the big budget re made garbage being released by hollywood today see it,1,1
6,6,boy this was one lousy movie while i havent seen all of the burton taylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put upon staff when shes suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it werent for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars,0,0,ok so i really like kris kristofferson and his usual easy going delivery of lines in his movies age has helped him with his soft spoken low energy style and he will steal a scene effortlessly but disappearance is his misstep holy moly this was a bad movie  i must give kudos to the cinematography and and the actors including kris for trying their darndest to make sense from this goofy confusing story none of it made sense and kris probably didnt understand it either and he was just going through the motions hoping someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about  i dont care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project or some such nonsense ive seen low budget movies that had a plot for goodness sake this had none zilcho nada zippo empty of reason a complete waste of good talent scenery and celluloid  i rented this piece of garbage for a buck and i want my money back i want my 2 hours back i invested on this grade f waste of my time dont watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where its playing or even open up the case that is holding the dvd believe me youll thank me for the advice,0,0

23,23,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want   if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killed 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny,1,1,i have to offset all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted its not like the sound of music but its as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i adored the late and great bobby vann and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters im a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in the boyfriend its a modern musical and shouldnt be judged by all that went before its just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place   no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isnt the greatest who cares i love the idea of the movie peter finch a very stiff actor liv ullmann gorgeous as ever sally kellerman surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it its not citizen kane its a feel good musical,1,1
58,58,spoilers wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so hes trying to figure out whos receiving the messages and whos also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and hes gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesnt see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end thats it  ive never seen such a dull movie in my life its the most underwhelming movie ive ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they dont care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasnt expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didnt expect it to be this bad christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well im sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst its beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever,0,0,28 years before 9 11 there was another 9 11 which represented a key date in the history of chile south america and the whole world this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allendes rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world true he was democratically elected but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis he was deposed by a coup and a right wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution well never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded the authors of the movie take a completely pro allende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future,0,0

168,168,judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukors film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again it never happened in it should happen to you i cant think of a blander title by the way holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde whos maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role cant muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up maybe if youre enamored of holliday youll enjoy this otherwise i wouldnt bother grade c,0,1,has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeders 1960s heroin opus sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic pink floyd score despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses a classic shamelessly ripped off by erich segal noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind 1971 although tippy walker playing a similar character is herself very junkie appealing in the latter mess more though is terrific a great 60s drug movie and simply an important document of its time very much a cult film so join the cult no american movie then as far as i can remember charts the same territory mimsys an astonishing archetype elevating this into mythic realms not for the faint hearted great sex scenes too,1,1
175,175,when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually dont care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audiencedone a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see 30 elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but 3 and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest 3 you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this,0,1,dragon ma jackie chanis back having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo back on land he is assigned to the police force where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb along the way he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble even if they are in the police force i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a but sadly i was a little disappointed there is just too little action compared to the first film there is just one good fight scene until the big ending that fight scene is in the gangsters place and its good a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw jackie chan and his stunt team dont disappoint here at all the ending is very entertaining jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world really exciting stuff the only bad thing with the ending is that the fights are too short and forgettable conclusion many funny moments good acting and crazy stunts but not enough fighting for a top rating,1,1
200,200,this movie is goofy as hell i think it was written as a serious film but then when it came time to film michael cooney said hey lets throw in some humor and spice it up the characters are actually slightly developed too oh and the death sequences are the best one thing i hate though was the hairdryer weapons what was that all about,1,0,the first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with jean smart but it really tanked after that this is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all i know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that willis was just as irritating in his younger self but i found this kid especially irritating and whinney,0,0
201,201,the movie shocked me personally i had herd mostly bad buzz well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes the best thing about the movie is its consistency with the relationship there were no exs popping up or characters threatening the relationship i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fatethey datesomething we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie but this movie did not follow that mold we actually experienced the relationship and its flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern timesand it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also its no my fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film ill simply say i like it,1,0,i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax as we all know betamax went the way of the 8 trak tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too anyways im glad i found this movie again ive been searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions bodylanguage mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel jekyll into the sex crazed partyanimal mr hyde is unforgettable complete with goldtooth chesthair and goldchains the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woos totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it,1,1
208,208,it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there &  the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop,0,1,of the thousands of movies ive seen so far this is the first one which made me think of the wasted talents expression i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances frÃ©dÃ©ric pierrot elsa zylbersteinand so on the aging make up is quite awful and to make it worse lit broadly the use of music eg love at first sight for the young aide de camp is at times so caricatural that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly so far antoine de caunes has been quite a good actor but seeing this one and les morsures de laube i think he should start considering quitting please antoine give up that master of balantree project  i doubt you deserve it,0,0
219,219,seeing this movie as i just did for the first time on turner classic which lists it as dangerous female can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogart astor version ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will they made him the actor he was the women are all good but no better than that well una merkel is a little better more interesting are the original joel cairo and mr gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles peter lorre and sydney greenstreet humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake here sam spade and ruth wonderley cant  this movie doesnt exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the 41 falcon dont just happen on the 1 to 10 scale i rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players,0,1,by now the games stale right the jokes have been done its all over the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone after all wrong the game is still intact the jokes are here folks sure theyre all rehash but so was monkey island 2 and 1 for that matter the difficulty is well placed somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2 the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate in the tradition of sub games and this game has the best joke of the whole series when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach always select you dont need to see my identification its worth the price of the game by itself,1,0
