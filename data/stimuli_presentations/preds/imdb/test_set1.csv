56,56,im easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable ive even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that ive seen that i can honestly say was badand this was it its been a while since ive seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this its honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend,0,0,is it just me or is this an awful film im going with its an awful film knowing full well that its a guy flick usually defined as full of car chases crashes gunfights explosions etc i still expect some small degree of credibility if i cant somehow believe in the premise the film will not work thus we come to the problem with assault on precinct 13 not one for spoilers i never report details of the plot however i will make an exception here because the plot is so inane bad guy is jailed in precinct 13 bad guys buddies want to bust him out surprise the bad guys buddies are actually corrupt cops brooding troubled but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl ugh yes it really is that simple and that dumb assault on precinct 13 takes place in detroit not a bad setting for crime and corruption i spent 3 months there in late 2004 so i know what im talking about even so its outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest i must have missed it there are no refunds for watching bad movies save your money there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $300 at blockbuster on this one final rating 1 only because i have seen worse films,0,0
26,26,a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must,1,1,the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something i mean halloween isnt that important is it anyway sheriff pete burton gilliam has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned co associate producer john william galt has discovered a body in the local woods could it be the fang lady justin hamilton the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers who knows being the fun sort of guy he is mark asisstant director & producer robert harvey convinces his missus kelly laurie reeves to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven josh gobin found the night before for a halloween party the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly & she agrees along with steven & a girl he picked up named camille natalie woods & their nerdy friend jerry tim boswell they all set out for a night of fun well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out edited executive produced written & directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film the script is very predictable dull & doesnt deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever in the right hands & with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isnt it moves along at a fair pace but the on screen action is so poor that it doesnt matter i dont quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film & i cant see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it the dialogue is basic the characters are clichéd & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time there are a few lame attempts at humour which dont sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage id imagine the budget didnt allow the filmmakers to show it oh if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then youll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed assuming you can actually make it that far of course believe me it takes some doing director abram doesnt do anything special abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish i can tell him that it isnt when your film is supposed to be set in the woods theres no atmosphere scares tension excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good forget about decent gore theres a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of $2837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release & to be brutally honest it shows what about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous the terrible special effects the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through the fanglys is straight to video crap it has no redeeming features whatsoever & its low imdb user rating score is fully justified its one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish,0,0
31,31,i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of its vision i enjoyed every page i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael radford might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book adopter the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writing you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting,0,0,this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap  the story dialogue acting special effects make up pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i cant believe how somebody produced this thing its not even about vampires its more about a dream reality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesnt exist everything seems like a big joke maybe thats what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired its definitely one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life and ive seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this  ps its also full of clichés ps 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography ps 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone,0,0
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,two teenagers in the north east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic misadventures but come up smiling in the end the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light hearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their adversaries are a callous teacher a pantomime villain of a father a psychotic skinhead and a well meaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim healy and kevin whateley both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so one dimensional that they have no more than novelty value chris beattie and greg mclane give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the sunderland durham area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor lad speak we say let the pooa lad speek while they say piwer lad spiyk with two distinctly different vowel sounds this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in sunderland football ground where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they dont have and *pretend* that they come from sunderland   which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit picking however the films bleak tone makes it clear that writer director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way off i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clichés tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause offence its interesting to compare the film with the same directors little voice   also largely downbeat and populated by one dimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesnt wallow in misery to the same extent ive heard belter ranked alongside this years billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life affirming experience incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on tyneside for 42 years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely belter,0,0
49,49,simply terrible why wouldnt you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget filmsplease for the love of god use real actors most will work for freetake advantage of that now back to my commentanyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasnt funny on any level as for the qualityin one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crewguess what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetishand it wasnt even good gore,0,0,the connection with james deanin a short plan we see emilio estevez toying with a teddy bearremember the first scene of rays rebel without a causemoreoverthe main conflict is estevez versus sheenfather against sonas in east of edenthe soldier has come homeand nobody has been able to communicate with him even his sister a psychology studentwhat a derisionthe mothera crude matron a superb kathy batesgets bogged down in nougatine she s not able to understand that her values religionfamily have become a thing of the pastspecially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed the father an irresolute man under his wifes thumbalthough he tries hard to play the machowanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life so he saved his honor by forcing his son to do his dutythe scene in which estevezs hatred for his father explodes is very intensethe actor director gives a restrained performanceinteriorizedas lee strasbergs students used to doand his final burst of anger is increased tenfold so,1,0
69,69,this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them hell try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain  and is signed  if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morriss story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the mans relationships ring true  inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out,1,1,this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed,1,1
40,40,this film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier *****spoiler alert***** polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesnt want to but polly decides to leave as she doesnt believe in marriage to begin with this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel its very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film its even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if its only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as theres something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesnt work as a comedy or as a romance,0,0,it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadnt seen before but wasnt sure why now after reflecting for quite some time i know its these characters that even now i still cant stop thinking about distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative yusuf who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer mahmut in the city in hopes to find employment however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim that hes really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of yusufs face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i dont know how long in the end mahmut has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second rating 10 out of 10,1,1
44,44,perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride,1,1,it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks this is a great horror spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances its laughs are subtle but plentiful because there is very little if any cgi there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera man must be sh%#@ing his pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so far more enjoyable than the big budget re made garbage being released by hollywood today see it,1,1
0,0,forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority dont translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully theres a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers dont look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with whats going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until its explained much later its one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered despite it clocking in under 90 minutes   i think its a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark   it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but its a classic case of too little too late what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as youll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel   it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit   its still not worth the time so better to avoid this,0,0,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few fantastic college weeks in barcelona myself the premise is right on cue  a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals but the directors weak swats at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused & disordered bravo perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european american pie flick then id be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride but right off the bat the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs the public self ones mother tongue vs ones secondary language furthermore it dives boldly into the subject of racial national stereotyping off to an interesting start eh wrong thats as far as it goes these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue type ending which seemed to be the directors way of floundering to get back on topic it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the speaker ends by saying so in conclusion i hope you see how this relates to my original thought furthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockney speaking beer swilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point whilst the europeans tolerate him superciliously why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs calling french people frogs and butchering the french language while everyone else is above all that the answer is that this isnt a deep or well thought out film its simply an anglophobes retort to the anglophiles but really its no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule now theres a funny irony to consider ok philosophy artistry & socio political commentary aside i was still very bored by this movie there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls boyfriends but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that id like to brush up on my french & spanish you see we monolingual americans may be stupid but we do try,0,0
57,57,upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s you must see this movie ,1,1,the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when im making fun of it jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i dont think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles   just watch the show and youll see what i mean now lets talk about the show zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows ive ever seen as a lot of people have already said zoey brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her shes a straight a student and all the boys think that shes hot pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat screen tvs and laptop computers serving kids sushi from the sushi bar in one of the newest episodes zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesnt even want chase to love her then when she barges into chases dorm room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca zoey of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is,0,0
