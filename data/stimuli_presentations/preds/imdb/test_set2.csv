61,61,this isnt one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members and two civilians the hero and heroine who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs the manipulations arent so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isnt going to be high what films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions this film lacks both for a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into mcclures hero is beyond routine and doesnt make much sense in any era the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care less a lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time,0,0,this is one of those strange self important self indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isnt instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity typical is the scene where peter kelsey grammer explains to protagonist and best friend adam dwier brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during adams travels through the mojave desert on foot he abruptly leaves la the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume hes dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson popeye and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen were stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound its a long trip which drags in many places in fact its the longest hour and a half movie ive ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv thatll learn me next time ill try harder to sleep in,0,0
70,70,the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the  thematic  conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity and the  physical  conflict between todd and his bio engineered replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different ways peoples screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half way through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little not a great film but one worth seeing,1,1,the racketeer stars carol deprived of the e that usually appeared at the end of her first name lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist roland drew who has since become a down and out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong top billed its virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies stiff direction immobile cameras stagy acting and ridiculously slow paced delivery of lines at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s l o w l y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs done about five years later this could have been an interesting movie but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorders dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies the racketeer was made in 1929 a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  vidors hallelujah mamoulians applause wylers hells heroes capras ladies of leisure  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically too bad howard higgin wasnt that strong as it is watching a naturally rapid paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way hes been told to speak one cant help but wonder where that 50 foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him,0,0
63,63,lars von triers europa is an extremely good film hows that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever,1,1,well im a few days late but what the hell anyways the word that best describes my reaction to see no evil wassurprise the film is actually pretty good there is definitely an ample amount of blood gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense it hearkens back to the good ole slasher days of the late 70s & early 80s think madman meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and youll get a good feel for this flick while sne is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violence methods of killing the gore suspense & the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars why youll just have to watch it & see pun intended there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho tcm & madman but theyre not blatant finally sne really doesnt go into territory we long timers havent seen before & granted sne is no pyscho or tcm 74 but it certainly merits a look imo  bloodstones recommendation take in a matinée showing of see no evil bloodstones rating 75 10,1,1
33,33,the story would never win awards but thats not what its about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really its worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7,1,0,this time the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out so the two get switched of course most of the movie is a series of gags in ernest goes to jail most of the gags relate to electricity i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on overall the point of the movie is just to have fun and im sure that you will this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud its quite safe to say that jim varney will truly be missed knowwhaddamean fyi the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall tex cobb who played lyle youve surely seen him somewhere,1,1
8,8,a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justice hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title i realized while re watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked,1,1,im a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didnt sufficiently heed good advice too bad i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watsons character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinsons control freak   moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lords dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me shes just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wifes affection increasing with every kick she gives him im not anti pc or anything it just didnt ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the directors intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just dont belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing im not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much my score 4 10,0,0
41,41,this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 the gun that won the west to cowman outlaw peace officer or soldier the winchester 73 was a treasured possession an indian would sell his soul to own one winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father riding into dodge city with his trusty friend johnny williams {millard mitchell} lin runs into dutch henry brown {stephen mcnally} the man he wants but with wyatt earp {will geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle a competition that lin eventually wins but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize dutch ambushes him steals the rifle and skips town fast as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle the rifle will changed hands a number of times with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches very much a benchmark for what became known as the so called psychological western winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback and in silhouette amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city its just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors the support cast isnt too bad either shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo while mitchell mcnally geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings theres even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far originally the film was a project for fritz lang who even had the script ready to run but lang walked away from it something that proved to be a blessing for western fans for as great as a director that lang was with mann directing {and with a new script from borden chase & robert richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre not only with the further efforts that mann & stewart produced but also in who they influenced the likes of budd boetticher nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes and gleefully for the western purists they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further a big hit at the box office back on release winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age 95 10,1,1,of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot une parisienne is widely regarded as one of her best what we see is special for once the plot has a value of its own does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for bbs sex charged appearance this film is your true & well worked out light comedy with a good and coherent story set in frances government circles in the late 1950s it entertains from beginning to end providing many amusing twists & turns and some slapstick    all acted out by at least three starring leads including bardot une parisienne = french for female inhabitant of paris focuses on telling a story not on showing brigitte bardot brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies when you settle on your couch on a friday night tired and weary from a weeks slaving away just turn on une parisienne this film will make you feel better,1,1
73,73,i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer verve gore vitality gore excitement gore utter campiness and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood,1,1,this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time when it finally came out i was really happy and looked forward to a 10 out of 10 it was great and lived up to my potential the performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids the only bad performance was by milo himself there was one problem that i encountered with this and others like it movie all of the characters i wanted to live were getting killed overall i give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10 maybe we should select better people to kill next time though ok,1,1
35,35,for daniel auteuil `queen margot was much better for nastassja kinski `paris texas was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges `crisscross and `a world apart cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `queen margot for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing,0,0,frantic somewhat mean spirited infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length the most i can praise son in law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and pauly shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and thats about it the story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes jury duty seem like gone with the wind   merk,0,0
32,32,an ultra modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre and deadly behavior or at least that is what lara flynn boyles character col kennedy argues after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door col knows something has got to give mark paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect my opinion the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations beautiful house and stylish sets boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing without her it would have failed its so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house yes it is alive but the story itself is not so much barring boyles presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners the results are predictable but i liked it anyway the cinematography lends the film a polished look 8 10 on account of boyle the premise of an evil ultra modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe,1,1,jean pierre melvilles le cercle rouge follows the lives of two criminals vogel gian maria volontè a murderer who gives the cops the slip while hes being transferred from one city to another by train and corey allain delon a thief just released from jail fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist in the background there is matei andré bourvil the detective vogel escapes from implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters the best of which is jansen yves montand a disgraced ex cop and an excellent marksman melville has such a unique style one doesnt need to watch many of his movies to catch on le samourai un flic and le cercle rouge are clearly made of the same cloth the symmetrical angles the long shots the silences the coats and hats and cigars the quotes at the beginning the amazing heists the fatalism the unglamorous and inglorious criminal life everything thats great in melville is present here in top form and his shortcomings didnt bother me so much this time the illogical perplexing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies are almost invisible here since le cercle rouge preceded un flic that doesnt mean he got better with time perhaps im just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesnt bother me anymore melville made unique crime movies as old as they may be they show more ingenuity realism and grace than the modern techno thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and james bond esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes melvilles criminals arent cool theyre lonely socially awkward and probably aware theyre not good for much more than planning heists theyre societys unwanted living in the night always one step ahead of the police in a game they know theyll lose eventually theres nothing romantic about them amazingly for a movie of this type the cops arent complete idiots either matei is smart crafty patient and even compassionate hes not an unlikeable villain or a cliché hes just an old man doing his job and doing it right he knows when to use force and when to use brains many movies could learn from him its this down to earth unromantic style that makes melvilles movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of cinemas great crime masters,1,1
36,36,as i write this review in 2008 we are mired in a remake culture movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including king kong the wicker man and practically every film that ever starred michael caine this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon however as dough for the do do proves an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampetts surreal masterpiece porky in wackyland dough for the do do sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampetts original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampetts source material although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampetts inspired insanity inevitably then dough for the do do is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached for cartoon fans like myself its equivalent to a colorization of casablanca,0,0,every time this movie used to re air on late night tv in the late 70s and early 80s i would always make time to sit in front of the tv and watch it to see the lovely kate jackson handsome richard long the great polly bergen whom ive never seen anywhere else except for this tv movie the endearing tom bosley and another great whom ive never seen outside this movie celeste holme this is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good and every time i would watch it i would always forget who the real murderer was as expected someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time i cant say that about half the movies ive seen this month if you ever get a chance to watch it on tv someday which isnt likely watch it in light of the girl most likely to finally coming out this year on dvd maybe theres hope for a dvd release of death cruise,1,1
