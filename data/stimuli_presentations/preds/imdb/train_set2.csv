5,5,there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlakes acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isnt all badjust mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of tenhes not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all ts just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia,0,0,firstly few colleges allow students to take courses from their parents lover secondly few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks thirdly few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm fourthly once a second member of a college small group project team meets a violent demise the college president will disband the whole class and not turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks,0,0
76,76,this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off watch enjoy its funny,1,1,i agree with so many of the other reviewers here this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish unfortunately i believe the author died before he could see this film made the performances are all top rate with the three principles john glover ben cross and veronica hamel seemingly made for their roles the exteriors both in europe and israel seem very authentic and the 4 hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story fortunately i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day i gave it a rating of 10 if you havent read the book you should really find a copy this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast,1,1
74,74,in what will probably find itself on my list of fullers best movies that is once i see more of them that just this and shock corridor pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale as well as the male protagonist are not the stereotypical ones in the genre like most of his other works fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood noirs on a small budget  at least for the likes of darryl f zanuck  fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who wont get violent with you even as theyre looking for an extra buck  richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who couldve really pulled off this character hes a little like bugs bunny as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky on the other hand the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesnt go into other peoples affairs and doesnt try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river after being sent away for three years he slips up unbeknownst to him when he pickpockets a woman peters on the train and lifts an item thats under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film as it involves stoolie moe ritter is one of the finest and most believable character actors from the period the womans ex a volatile kiley and the police department aside from the thematic elements which are told with a keen dramatic journalistic style as was fullers previous position along with boxer the dialog is fresh and involving theres a spontaneity in many of fullers camera moves and what a third act this is a lean tight film noir that is worth checking out even if youre not familiar with fuller its comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works,1,1,with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider this can be pretty annoying symbols and references to art and popular culture abound the movie alludes to the work of salvador dalí luis buñuel and the surrealists in general a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to duchamps ready mades whats more the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital impetuous boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time how all the really pretty women run after him the main character i mean is slightly disconcerting the movie has three parts it starts in the spanish enclave of melilla in africa where benito the main character does his military service apparently in the corps of engineers then it moves on to the resort town of benidorm in spanin where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized howard roark for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami florida presumably in order to start a new life but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflated i purchased this movie because i am interested in townscapes and benidorm is a kind of a special place townscapewise in this aspect huevos de oro satisfied me only partially in jess francos she killed in ecstasy 1970 this specific location was used in a more rewarding way,0,0
64,64,no hidden agenda pure scifi all fun i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid  the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen bullet is by far the better and only version anyone should see the movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord 10 10  zafoid,1,1,the man who knew too much{1956}is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesnt have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech  it tells the story of a married couple {james stewart and doris day}vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens hes an agent thats looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leaderthen he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that hes a spyand proceeds to fall into stewarts armsdyinghe tells him the whole story of the assassination plotstewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their sonthe film contains excellent performances by stewart and dayin a straight dramatic roleas worried and frightened parentsthis film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicalsthe direction by alfred hitchcock is top notchthe film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minutethe scene in albert hall is a classicthe original is so slow paced and drabi dont know how people can compare the twojust watch the remake and youll enjoy iti give the movie a 9 out of 10,1,0
67,67,read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake outs  there is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths this is one of my favorites of the year  originally written 7 28 2002,1,1,there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors back in the late 80s and early 90s when his name was attached to several great films like the lost boys flatliners and falling down he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood then came the stupid batman sequels unfortunately and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumachers hands both 8mm and phone booth could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of the number 23 should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie literally from start to finish the number 23 desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichés from the big book of cinema history including heavy voiced narration flashbacks disorderly structure characters with multiple personalities numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings nothing helps however simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open minded regarding the insane theories this still remains a movie about a two digit number and two digit numbers arent scary walter sparrow jim carrey in a rare non comical role is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23 walter almost promptly identifies himself with the books protagonist a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life i did some research on google and wikipedia and apparently this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number well thats just  crazy but hey im not here to judge peoples beliefs and fears regardless of how demented they are and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out and out berserk enigma the number 23 is not suspenseful in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make up effects and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life all cast members perform below their normal capacities but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs virginia madsen in a relatively big production again definitely not recommended in case youre looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun but endurable and not entirely without merit,0,0
119,119,the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy theres something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter i do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning as it stands only the die hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie,0,0,like richard pryor mason never got the material he deserved whatever you know of him is probably wrong get past the accent and go see his stand up youll be very surprised    hes one of the best stand ups ive ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand up comedy from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock    jackie mason is definitely up there hes known for being a comics comic even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan dangerfields career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following masons shows that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his get no respect routine while i think dangerfield is great see them both do stand up and youll see mason is the better comedian,1,1
88,88,airport 77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them & a bunch of vips to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan & her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid air the plane is hi jacked by the co pilot chambers robert foxworth & his two accomplices banker monte markham & wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivors as they await help with time fast running out also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash hit disaster thriller airport 1970 was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like its predecessors i cant say airport 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid air hi jacking & then the crashing didnt he see the oil rig & sinking of the 747 maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure 1972 & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & its a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters dull dialogue lethargic set pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & theres not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things dont pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but theres just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background the home video & theatrical version of airport 77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out characters longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport 77 as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects arent great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie awards hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon thats a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isnt great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too airport 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production & bland direction doesnt help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldnt be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde  airport 79 1979,0,1,i saw this as a kid before it had been yanked from the rotation and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some competently worked out gags but making slapstick villains out of american citizens whod been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless  moe himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close moe stepped into the street to show it wasnt a problem and the man then got back on the curb then off again finally the man told moe nervously that if moe didnt stop trying to share the sidewalk with him he might get them both lynched another thing there are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film so the title should actually be if anyone cares the yolks on me,0,0

34,34,when my 14 year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night theres one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k 911 the third installment in the highly successful k 9 franchise starring everybodys favorite tv dad jim belushi folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that its starting to skip no joke but of course youll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesnt measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k 9 movies some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment   direct to video at that   may not seem like something worth watching youd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie i wont give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet   one that will have you howling with laughter its a shame john belushi isnt alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party dont forget the puppy chow,1,1,the main premise for this movie is every womans fantasy a vagina that kills and eats men well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man whats that 999999% of women but dont worry its not a gory kind of eating of men its more like a comical slurping them in like a drain plug theres no blood or parts left behind so for blood guts & gore fans forget about this film not much gore here the two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute meanwhile dennis is a nice guy who stalks helen the story is already a little silly at this point but then they throw in two more equally silly sub stories that just send this movie into the bad b movie territory the first new sub story is about dennis finding new love with a pair of conjoined twins and then eventually murdering one of them and becoming a fugitive bank robber the second new sub story is about helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitution related bad date and decided he wanted to marry her dennis and helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances and magically helens murderous vagina is cured,0,0
59,59,revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow  and i mean slow  build up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader and when that finally comes its pretty all right not great not even good but pretty all right this movie is being vastly over praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels instead its just turgid dull and routine but you have to say wow those cgi environments are really impressive at times bu the lightsabre fights theyre all a blurry mess i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed this will make a ton of money but thank god its over this once worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough i saw the 1201 show and after it i heard a group of very small kids say wow that was awesome but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing i fell asleep in the middle it was kind of boring i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better so said we all,0,0,cybrog 2glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks rhymes with kicks a karate instructor who helps a cash jolie escape from pinwheel her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to displace the duo while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast the original had jean claude van damme and dayle haddon dont know her well she was in a bunch of 70s pornos this one has jack palance elias koteasbilly drago and angelina jolie the third one has william katt zach galligan and malcom mcdowell okay so cyborg 3s cast isnt that impressive ive never seen cyborg 3 but i did see this on sci fi channel and must admit i wasnt impressed actually strike that cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie its shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye however cyborg 1 was the same way indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye unfortunately like the first this one doesnt have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom so for various reasons the movie doesnt have much to offer beyond its look another aspect is the terrible acting karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isnt much better elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor i guess on the positive side you cant accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway it has nothing to do with its predecessor which this manages to be worse than * out of 4 bad,0,0
52,52,well i guess ill have to be the one to say the emperor has no clothes when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive i loved morse even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set and felt that while i always liked kevin whatelys sgt lewis character the show was john thaw period after watching the new inspector lewis as it is billed here i am more convinced then ever that i was rightwhately is fine even though he looks awful both badly aged and too fat but he simply doesnt have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw and as for his sidekick fox wellperhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what hes saying but i for one mostly could not as for ms innocentall i can say is that i miss james grout im sorry to say that they should have left morse rest in peace,0,0,some movies are off beat but enjoyable but many movies are just mind numbingly weird motorama fits not so nicely in the latter category many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and motorama simply doesnt have any other merits to its credit motorama delights itself on plot improbabilities its main character gus is a cussing 10 year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million when interacting with adult figures none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that hes 10 years old at first its incredibly funny but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing to someone that age imagery going on around him gus has no depth and as an anti hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces its hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances each mistreating gus in more and more strange ways besides making the already worn out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable the characters share gus lack of depth and are equally unmemorable the characters actions can get a little interesting but the actors themselves dont add anything to them thus negating the whole point of getting big names they couldve been played by anyone and the character wouldve been the same these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else motorama should be interesting   its a unique idea but theres too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti hero and the viewer dont as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus that never happens as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt one incident after another with a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level motorama has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich why should we care about that,0,0

128,128,this movie is a farce names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous cannon crossbow weapon beowulf doesnt need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off grendels arm with his bare hands and i cant believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a die hard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldnt recommend it,0,0,if youre a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance sergei eistenstein like other silent film pioneers like griffith although eisensteins innovations are not as commonplace as griffiths and murnau has had such an impact on the history of cinema its of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether youd like it or not your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the odessa stairs sequence of this film its hard to say if its even the best part of the films several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the russian revolution but it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense or just plain montage the untouchables climax comes to mind montage which was not just eistensteins knack but also his lifes blood early in his career is often misused in the present cinema or if not misused then in an improper context for the story sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b montage was something else for eisenstein he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passions and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place even if one doesnt see all of eisensteins narrative or traditional story ideas to have much grounding kubrick has said this one cant deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20s it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by eisenstein himself on the film in and of itself battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other head ups of a certain ship this is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in spurts of energy that capture the eye other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water he isnt one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early 20th century russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the end some may want to check it outside of film school as the stairs sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution eisenstein may not be one of the more accessible silent film directors but if montage detail in the frame non actors and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea its truly one of the must sees of a lifetime,1,1

37,37,the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because theres nothing else there to show gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film i dont really think they exist i think they bought this script at scripts r us where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blanks theres a monster stalking us lets split up they actually lets split up in this movie hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar not dead yet burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie ir glasses spraying with something like paint were handled badly  what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it stunk i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i dont want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they dont think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than,0,0,i bought the dvd out of a big bin for $499 thinking id lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the karakoram mountains and k2 in particular fast forwarding through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of      mount waddington towering to all of 13260 ft in canadas coastal range at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb k2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like    he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldnt have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the films premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on k2 you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale while good enough for the likes of reinhold messner are beneath him to be honest i havent watched the whole thing what ive seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at $499 ive been ripped off,0,0
38,38,i saw this jolly little film at age 10 11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs i didnt know it had been in a theater at all to rate it from a kids point of view id give it 4 out of 5 starsbecause being a young boy at the timeit seemed a little girlish the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing  when i re discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995i had to revisit it i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old i dont know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasnt on vhs its out there might even be on dvd by nowat least i hope it is i want to share it with my kids someday 10 stars on hereits still a great kids film end 09 08 2009  finally found a vhs copy woo hoo,1,1,a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrongthe creators become trapped in a remote desert outpostpursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creationjames stocktonthe scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monsteris called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark hallsjamestogether with his son and daughtersoon find themselves trapped inside with the otherstrying desperately to surviveand with the outpost sealed from withinthere is no way outthe outpost mind ripper is highly unoriginalthe sets are pretty claustrophobic and theres a bit of gorehowever as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levelstheres zero suspensethe script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictableso called master wes craven produced this one i wonder if he is happy with this trashjoe gayton directs without any stylethe acting is horribleonly lance henriksen can act at allokim a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointedavoid it like the plague its just the same old boring crap again,0,0
13,13,there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this onethere are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters dont spend the time on this one,0,0,we can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world those who understand binary and those who do not those who understand binary put this movie to its grave along with hackers while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake that none of this crap could happen ever  for a movie to attempt to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it it has failed horribly only a 11yr old and below can enjoy and only 30yr and up could be scared to have their identity taken it losses out on the main market for a resale valuei watch it now it is more boring than when it was first released,0,0
62,62,very dull obvious tedious exorcist rip off featuring a doberman with red eyes   thats the extent of the special effects in this made for tv cheapie richard crenna is about as animate as a chew toy very 70s dress & music only add to the torture should put you to sleep almost as fast as the corpse vanishes or the blue hand practically worthless moocow says eaghhh what a stinky dog =8p,0,0,and nothing else one of my friends bought the problem child tantrum pack contains the first two problem childs in one disc and we decided to watch the sequel because it was funnier there were many funny moments in the movie the vomit scene thats all i need to say nippy the dog after eating chow down and numerous others the movie is nothing but toilet humor but its hilarious other than the funny moments though this movie has little to offer john ritter annoys the crap out of me because it sounds like hes reading out of a book the man cant act in this one sorry although i cant say if i would find the movie funny nowwe were blown when we watched it its a perfect movie for a rainy daybut nothing else dont expect oscar material on this one guys,0,0
65,65,you think youve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one,1,1,its just when a band tours and only has one original member its not the same as the classic line up all new actors playing the main roles of rag scotty etc with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie and he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females the film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon even for a t&a movie this one is a turkey not even die hard low budget 80s films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting this film would have been better off never being released just plain bad,0,0
101,101,i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash i dont agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot   which is a point i agree with it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand standing oscar hunting lets create an enduring image for my liking the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case youre missing the point let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war if that fact alone doesnt convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance  personally i do not support americas decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly dont subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i dont think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring   unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy,0,0,another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden it doesn´t work except for widerbergs still unsurpassed mannen på taket stormare does the best he can i suppose and some scenes are mildly effective but the plot is full of holes why does hamilton continue the attack on the base knowing that his wife is held hostage it was fun to see mark hamill but his bad guy part was very underwritten i´m constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible functioning script 1 out of 5,0,0
137,137,expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrong ill start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and its due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle room to do his thing hes an undoubtedly talented individual and its a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total train wreck with that out of the way ill discuss what went horrifyingly wrong the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column he prepares his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this its almost as if theyve been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver they are a caricature of what we think a family is when were 7 it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football crossword puzzle competitions family bowling and talent shows are not how actual people behave its almost sickening another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i dont think it was much,0,0,but its not the plot isnt all that bad the actors arent all terrible so it should be decent instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those i cant believe he she is so dumb moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going it frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie anticipation is great but you cant spend over half the movie building it up a shame too since it got decent exposure upon release and hit right before the big halloween season even so i have a feeling this is going to get at least one sequel if not more so maybe theyll be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent,0,0
89,89,this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series,1,1,this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek and i havent watched trek in years it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way it also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series the cgi definitely doesnt overcome the plot or the characters except for nim the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbors yippy dog is a 1 in my book he was a stroke of genius  i am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones i hope and crossing my fingers and toes that nbc or someone else sci fi maybe will continue to run the series and answer those questions  a really great classy show,1,1
57,57,upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s you must see this movie ,1,1,the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when im making fun of it jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i dont think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles   just watch the show and youll see what i mean now lets talk about the show zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows ive ever seen as a lot of people have already said zoey brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her shes a straight a student and all the boys think that shes hot pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat screen tvs and laptop computers serving kids sushi from the sushi bar in one of the newest episodes zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesnt even want chase to love her then when she barges into chases dorm room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca zoey of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is,0,0
69,69,this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them hell try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain  and is signed  if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morriss story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the mans relationships ring true  inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out,1,1,this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed,1,1
114,114,what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot,0,0,do you like explosions how about fighting well this movie has both of those you know the other thing you cant have a movie without a kick ass motorcycle the type that bounces off someones head and knocks them out at the same time you bet the stabilizer has one theres even a classic cliff scene all in all im quite proud that i have even seen this movieand even prouder to have my review be the first oneyes,1,1
